# General Contract Manager

![Galaxis Logo](logo.svg)

The **General Contract Manager** is an open-source tool for managing contract access and ownership for teams and organizations. It supports **batch calling multiple methods** and **method level access control** per user for every registered contract.
 
## Why?

Organizations and teams developing web3 applications are exposed to the risk of losing ownership and control over their own contracts in the case of a leaving teammate, losing the deployer's private keys, or a planned attack. 
- **Whenever an Ownable contract belongs to a single wallet a team is exposed to this unnecessary risk of losing ownership over it.**
- **Developers in a team may need to access some `onlyOwner` methods but must have no right over others.**
- **Both developers and administrators may need to take multiple actions with deployed contracts, hence the need for batch calling.**
- **An easy and quick way is always needed to revoke access rights of a wallet over all company / team assets.**
- **GCM takes out the single point of failure.**
